"""MCMC densification (3DGS-MCMC, Kheradmand et al., NeurIPS 2024).

Dead gaussians are *relocated* onto live ones rather than pruned-and-regrown,
so the population size is controlled explicitly instead of emerging from
clone/split heuristics. `grow_to` additionally ramps the active count toward a
cap, which is both a quality lever (capacity when the optimiser can use it)
and a speed lever (early steps run on a fraction of the final splats).

Correctness notes -- the first implementation got all of these wrong:

* **Multiplicity.** When N copies share one gaussian's job, each needs
  `o_new = 1 - (1-o)^(1/N)` so the stack composites back to `o`. Assuming
  N == 2 (`1 - sqrt(1-o)`) leaves every 3+-way relocation too transparent.
* **Duplicate picks.** `multinomial(replacement=True)` returns repeats, and
  `params[dead] = params[pick]` is a *scatter*: repeats silently last-write-
  win, so the intended N-way split became a 1-way copy with N-1 stragglers.
  Multiplicity is now counted with bincount and applied to the target too.
* **Placement.** Copies go AT the target, not jittered off it -- the noise
  term is what explores; jittering here just desynchronises the split.
* **Adam state.** A relocated row carries momentum from its previous life and
  a second moment that mis-scales its first steps. Both are zeroed.
